	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, often denoted as the "big O" notation. It provides an estimation of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient, making it crucial in evaluating and comparing different algorithms for the same task.
	</p>
<p><b> Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space that an algorithm requires to execute. It is also expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. A key consideration in optimizing algorithms is minimizing space complexity. <b>Space Complexity</b> is particularly important in scenarios where memory resources are limited or costly.
